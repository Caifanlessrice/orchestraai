*   **VN Staff Logs:** A view to see the coordination logs with the VN staff.
*   **Parents' Health:** A view to see the health status of the user's parents.

## Current Plan

The current plan is to convert the existing React application to a web component-based application. This will involve the following steps:

1.  Create a `blueprint.md` file to outline the plan and structure of the application.
2.  Create the necessary files for the web components, including `index.html`, `style.css`, and `main.js`.
3.  Create separate JavaScript files for each of the application's views.
4.  Populate these files with the code to create the web components, including the HTML structure, styling, and event handling logic.
5.  Add the routing logic to `main.js` to handle transitions between the different views.
6.  Add some global styles to `style.css` to ensure a consistent look and feel across the application.
